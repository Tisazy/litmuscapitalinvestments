                <h2>Investment Strategy</h2>
                <h3>The Philosophy of "Catching the Spike"</h3>
                <p>Our core strategy revolves around identifying undervalued, low-capitalization listed equities before the market recognizes their true worth. We invest early and hold patiently to "catch the spike" when the value is ultimately realized.</p>
                <h3>Focus and Analysis</h3>
                <p>We conduct exhaustive fundamental, bottom-up analysis on all potential investments. We do not use hype terms like "guaranteed returns" or "fast profits." Our focus is on markets, growth, and discipline.</p>
